### Final Project Description
These data are from a retrospective sample of males in a heart-disease high-risk region of the Western Cape, South Africa. There are roughly two controls per case of coronary heart disease, CHD. Many of the CHD positive men have undergone blood pressure reduction treatment and other programs to reduce their risk factors after their CHD event. In some cases the measurements were made after these treatments.
